# LIFI-data-transmission
The aim is to enhance data transmission rates and reliability beneath the water's surface, where traditional 
radio frequency methods are less effective. Unlike Wi-Fi which uses radio frequencies, Li-Fi (Light fidelity) 
technology uses light as a data transmission medium. Li-Fi belongs to the higher wireless optical 
communication category and operates in the visible light band, which has higher data transfer rates than WIFI.
